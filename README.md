**DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

1. Introduction

In many fields such as business analytics, research, and data science, it is common to generate regular reports that summarize the insights obtained from datasets. Traditionally, this process is manual and time-consuming. Analysts often have to load data into Excel, calculate statistics, create charts, and then format everything into a document or presentation.

The Automated Report Generation System aims to simplify this workflow. By using Python, along with libraries like Pandas for data handling and ReportLab (or FPDF) for PDF generation, the system can automatically:

Read a dataset from a file.

Analyze the data (descriptive statistics, trends).

Generate a formatted PDF report containing summaries, tables, and optionally charts.

This saves time, ensures consistency, and can be adapted to multiple datasets with minimal modification.

2. Objectives

The main objectives of the task are:

Develop a Python script that reads data from a structured file (CSV).

Perform basic data analysis such as calculating mean, minimum, maximum, and distribution statistics.

Create a well-formatted PDF report that includes:

Report title and metadata (date, author/system).

Tabular summary of key statistics.

Graphical visualization (optional).

Ensure the solution is reusable and modular, so users can easily apply it to different datasets.

Provide a sample dataset and sample generated PDF report to demonstrate functionality.

3. Tools and Libraries

The implementation leverages the following tools and libraries:

Python 3.x → Core programming language.

Pandas → For data analysis (reading CSV, calculating statistics).

ReportLab → For generating professional PDF documents.

Matplotlib (optional) → For creating plots/visualizations.

OpenPyXL (optional) → For Excel file handling if needed.
